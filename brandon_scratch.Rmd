- implement tangent (derivative-based) adaptive rejection sampler

- INPUTS: sample number
- check density
- check log concave density
- generate enveloping function
- squeezing function
- from sample number, do loop
  - etc. etc. 
  
## function for intersection of tangent lines for x_{j} and x_{j+1}
```{r}

dist_a <- 
```
