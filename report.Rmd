## Functions

We created a very modular solution for our Adaptive-Rejection Sampler, which handled unique subtasks within individual functions. Below, we list each function we created and its modular purpose:

* get_initial_abscissae(): Takes in the log of the density and the domain of the density as well as optional arguments k, the number of abscissae; x_start, the initial abscissae values to try; and x_step, the amount to step if the derivative value at the x_start is not the appropriate sign. This function is called within ars() to set the initial abscissae.
* get_z(): Takes in an index j, a vector of abscissae x, and a concave function h and calculates the coordinate of the intersection point between the tangent lines to h at x[j] and x[j+1]. This function is called within get_z_all() in a vectorized fashion to get the vector of z's.
* get_z_all(): Takes in a vector of abscissae x and a concave function h and calculates the vector of z's (tangent line intersection points) by calling an apply function that applies get_z() to the elements of x. This function is called within ars() to recreate the z vector each time the abscissae get updated.
* get_u_segment(): Takes in an index j, a vector of abscissae x, and a concave function h and calculates the slope and intercept of the tangent line to h at x[j]. This function is called within get_u() in a vectorized fashion to get all the piece-wise segments of the upper bound of h.
* get_u(): Takes in a vector of abscissae x and a concave function h and applies get_u_segment() to get the entire piece-wise upper bound of h. This function is called within ars() to recreate the upper bound each time the abscissae get updated.
* get_l_segment(): Takes in an index j, a vector of abscissae x, and a concave function h and calculates the slope and intercept of the chord from x[j] to x[j+1]. This function is called within get_l() in a vectorized fashion to get all the piece-wise segments of the lower bound of h.
* get_l(): Takes in a vector of abscissae x and a concave function h
